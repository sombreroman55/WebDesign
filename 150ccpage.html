		<h1>150cc</h1>
		<p>150cc is my pet project. It is a video game music cover band in layman's terms, but I prefer the term video game music <em>arrangement</em> band, since we don't (or at least try not to) play the songs straight through as they were originally written. I listen to video game music almost all the time and really appreciate its musicality. I understand that it's a very niche music to play for the masses, but I don't really care. I'm not in it for the money. I'm in it because I love video game music and I love playing it.</p>
		
		<p>150cc originally started in 2013 with a different lineup than it currently has. I had the idea back in high school but could not convince any of my friends to get behind the idea. Eventually I was able to convince a few friends to join and we had the lineup:
			<ul>
				<li>Andrew Roberts - Drums</li>
				<li>Matt Bateman - Keyboards</li>
				<li>Casey "Fish" Preece - Guitar</li>
				<li>Marcus Renlund - Bass</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>I think Fish only joined to placate me and give me incentive to stay in Beach Cops (my other band, which you can learn more about <a href="beachcopspage.html">here</a>.) As a result, our original lineup had no chemistry and none of our arrangements were inspired. Fish was often very late and never truly learned any of the melodies, and to keep it short there were just a lot of issues. So the project was put on hold for a while, though never officially scrapped. Finally, in 2016, I was able to convince all my of my closest musician friends to take up the project again. The band was reborn with a new lineup:
			<ul>
				<li>Andrew Roberts - Drums</li>
				<li>Matt Bateman - Keyboards</li>
				<li>Casey "Fish" Preece - Guitar</li>
				<li>Marcus Renlund - Bass</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>A similar lineup, but one with much more chemistry. The band has really taken off and is becoming more of what I had in mind when I first envisioned it. There are still things I want us all to improve on and things that I want us to do to take our music to the next level, but I am very satisfied with the direction it has gone.
		</p>
		
		<p>As it is my pet project, I go to great lengths for this band. We have recorded all of our shows so far and I plan to record all future ones as well. We upload them to our Soundcloud for fans to listen to. A list of past shows, their recordings, and upcoming shows can be found <a href="150ccshows.html">here</a>.</p>
