		<h1>Drumming</h1>
		<p>I love drums. I've been playing for about 10 years now. At the moment, I have no big projects to speak of, but do have an old project and a project in the works. 
		The old project is Beach Cops and the project in the works is called 150cc. Beach Cops is a hard-rock, "post-hardcore" band (The actual genre is a mystery to me), and 150cc is a video game music cover band.
		In the beginning I taught myself for the most part for about a year, after which I started taking private lessons. I took private lessons for about 2 and a half years before returning to self-study.
		Recently I have wanted to take private lessons again to fine tune my technique and start getting into more advanced topics that are perhaps beyond me both in terms of ability to play and understand.</p>
