		<h1>Development</h1>
		<p>I enjoy learning how to develop new things. I'm studying Computer Science, although it seems to outsmart me on a daily basis. I'm trying my hardest to learn, but I really suck at it. Despite my best efforts I'm still trash. 
		Oh well. Here is a link to my Github page where you can review my great code and see for yourself why I will never get hired. Also check <a href="developmentprojects.html">this</a> out.</p>
