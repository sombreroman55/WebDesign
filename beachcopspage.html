		<h1>Beach Cops</h1>
		<p>Beach Cops is currently an old project of mine. It is comprised of Casey "Fish" Preece on guitar, Marcus Renlund on bass, and myself on drums. It's a hard rock, "post-hardcore" band. 
		The songs are written entirely by Fish, then myself and Marcus add our own interpretation of our respective parts underneath. The vocals are terrible. Just awful. But that's what Fish wants, so we humor him. 
		We have recorded one EP available for free (or however much you wish to give) on Bandcamp, and are currently on hiatus. Click the album cover below to go to our Bandcamp page, or click on the Facebook logo to go to our Facebook.</p>
